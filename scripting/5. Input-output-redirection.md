### Input and Output Redirection in Shell Scripting

Input and output redirection in shell scripting allows you to control where the shell receives input from and sends output to. This feature makes shell scripts powerful for automating tasks, as you can direct the flow of data between files, devices, or other programs.

There are three standard data streams in Linux:
1. **Standard Input (stdin)**: Input data stream (usually input from the keyboard).
   - File descriptor: `0`
2. **Standard Output (stdout)**: Output data stream (usually printed to the terminal).
   - File descriptor: `1`
3. **Standard Error (stderr)**: Error messages output stream (usually printed to the terminal).
   - File descriptor: `2`

### Types of Redirection

1. **Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`)**
2. **Input Redirection (`<`)**
3. **Error Redirection (`2>`, `2>>`)**
4. **Redirect stdout and stderr together (`&>`, `&>>`)**
5. **Pipes (`|`)**

---

### 1. **Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`)**

#### **Single Output Redirection (`>`)**

The `>` operator is used to redirect the standard output to a file, replacing the file's contents if it already exists.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
```

In this example, the message "Hello, World!" will be written to the file `output.txt`. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

#### **Append Output Redirection (`>>`)**

The `>>` operator appends the output to the file without overwriting it.

```bash
echo "This is a new line" >> output.txt
```

This will append the line "This is a new line" to the `output.txt` file, preserving the existing contents.

---

### 2. **Input Redirection (`<`)**

The `<` operator is used to redirect input from a file instead of the keyboard.

#### Example: Reading Input from a File

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while read line
do
    echo "Read line: $line"
done < input.txt
```

In this example, the script reads each line from the `input.txt` file and prints it to the terminal. The `< input.txt` redirects the file as the input source for the `read` command.

---

### 3. **Error Redirection (`2>`, `2>>`)**

By default, error messages (stderr) are printed to the terminal. You can redirect error messages to a file using the `2>` operator.

#### **Redirecting Errors to a File**

```bash
ls /nonexistent_directory 2> error.log
```

In this example, any error messages (like trying to list a non-existent directory) will be redirected to `error.log`.

#### **Appending Errors to a File**

```bash
ls /another_nonexistent_directory 2>> error.log
```

This appends the error messages to the `error.log` file, preserving previous contents.

---

### 4. **Redirect stdout and stderr Together (`&>`, `&>>`)**

You can redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file using `&>`. This is useful when you want to capture all output and errors together.

#### **Redirect Both stdout and stderr**

```bash
command &> output_and_errors.log
```

This redirects both standard output and standard error to `output_and_errors.log`.

#### **Appending Both stdout and stderr**

```bash
command &>> output_and_errors.log
```

This appends both standard output and standard error to `output_and_errors.log`.

---

### 5. **Pipes (`|`)**

Pipes (`|`) are used to send the output of one command as input to another command. This allows you to chain commands together to process data.

#### Example: Using Pipes

```bash
cat file.txt | grep "search_term"
```

In this example, the `cat` command outputs the contents of `file.txt`, which is then passed through the pipe (`|`) as input to the `grep` command to search for the term "search_term".

#### Example: Combining Multiple Commands with Pipes

```bash
ps aux | grep "bash" | wc -l
```

This example counts how many instances of the `bash` shell are running. It works by:
1. Listing all processes with `ps aux`.
2. Filtering the output for lines containing "bash" using `grep`.
3. Counting the lines with `wc -l`.

---

### Redirecting to `/dev/null` (Discarding Output)

Sometimes you may want to suppress or discard the output. You can redirect it to `/dev/null`, a special file that discards anything written to it.

#### Example: Discarding Output

```bash
command > /dev/null
```

This redirects the output of `command` to `/dev/null`, effectively ignoring it.

#### Example: Discarding Errors

```bash
command 2> /dev/null
```

This discards any error messages from `command`.

### Summary of Redirection Operators

| Operator     | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `>`          | Redirect stdout to a file (overwrite)        |
| `>>`         | Redirect stdout to a file (append)           |
| `<`          | Redirect input from a file                   |
| `2>`         | Redirect stderr to a file (overwrite)        |
| `2>>`        | Redirect stderr to a file (append)           |
| `&>`         | Redirect both stdout and stderr (overwrite)  |
| `&>>`        | Redirect both stdout and stderr (append)     |
| `|`          | Pipe: Redirect stdout to another command     |

### Example: Complete Shell Script with Redirection

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create a file and write output to it
echo "This is stdout output" > output.txt

# Append to the file
echo "Appending more output" >> output.txt

# Redirect an error message to a file
ls /nonexistent_directory 2> error.txt

# Discard the output of a command
echo "This output will be discarded" > /dev/null

# Pipe the output of one command into another
cat output.txt | grep "Appending"
```

This script demonstrates various types of redirection, including writing output to files, appending to files, redirecting errors, discarding output, and piping commands.
