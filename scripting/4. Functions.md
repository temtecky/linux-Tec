### Functions in Shell Scripting

Functions in shell scripting allow you to group a set of commands into a single reusable block of code. They help make your script more modular and easier to maintain. You can define a function once and call it multiple times within the same script, passing arguments to it if necessary.

#### **Syntax of a Function**

```bash
function_name () {
    # Commands
}
```

Or:

```bash
function function_name {
    # Commands
}
```

#### **Calling a Function**

Once defined, you can call the function by simply writing its name:

```bash
function_name
```

### Examples of Functions in Shell Scripting

#### **Example 1: Simple Function**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function
greet() {
    echo "Hello, welcome to shell scripting!"
}

# Call the function
greet
```

**Output**:
```
Hello, welcome to shell scripting!
```

#### **Example 2: Function with Arguments**

Functions can accept arguments. The arguments are accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc., inside the function.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function that accepts arguments
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1! Welcome to $2."
}

# Call the function with arguments
greet "Alice" "Linux"
```

**Output**:
```
Hello, Alice! Welcome to Linux.
```

In this example, `$1` refers to "Alice" and `$2` refers to "Linux".

#### **Example 3: Function with Return Value**

In shell scripting, functions can return an exit status (an integer), not a direct value. You can capture the output of a function using command substitution.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function that performs an arithmetic operation
add_numbers() {
    local result=$(( $1 + $2 ))
    echo $result
}

# Call the function and capture the output
sum=$(add_numbers 5 10)
echo "The sum is: $sum"
```

**Output**:
```
The sum is: 15
```

In this example, the function calculates the sum of two numbers and `echo` prints the result. The result is captured in the variable `sum` using command substitution `$(...)`.

#### **Example 4: Function with Conditional Logic**

You can use conditionals inside functions to create more complex logic.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function to check if a file exists
check_file() {
    if [ -f "$1" ]; then
        echo "File '$1' exists."
    else
        echo "File '$1' does not exist."
    fi
}

# Call the function with a file path
check_file "/etc/passwd"
```

**Output**:
```
File '/etc/passwd' exists.
```

In this example, the function checks if the given file exists and prints an appropriate message.

#### **Example 5: Recursive Function**

A function can call itself, which is known as recursion. Hereâ€™s a simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a recursive function to calculate factorial
factorial() {
    if [ $1 -le 1 ]; then
        echo 1
    else
        local temp=$(( $1 - 1 ))
        local result=$(factorial $temp)
        echo $(( $1 * result ))
    fi
}

# Call the function
result=$(factorial 5)
echo "Factorial of 5 is: $result"
```

**Output**:
```
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

In this example, the function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

#### **Example 6: Using `return` in Functions**

While shell functions typically output data using `echo`, they can also return an exit status using `return`. This is especially useful for indicating success or failure.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function that returns success or failure
check_number() {
    if [ $1 -gt 10 ]; then
        return 0  # Success
    else
        return 1  # Failure
    fi
}

# Call the function and check the exit status
check_number 15
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "Number is not greater than 10."
fi
```

**Output**:
```
Number is greater than 10.
```

In this example, the function uses `return` to indicate success (`0`) or failure (`1`). The special variable `$?` captures the exit status of the last executed command.
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Function to print details of the bank and welcome the user
function welcome_message() {
  echo "**************************************"
  echo "* Welcome to Danske Bank - Denmark   *"
  echo "**************************************"
  echo ""
  echo "At Danske Bank, we are committed to offering exceptional services to our customers."
  echo "Here are three exclusive offers available for new customers:"
  echo "1. Free checking account for the first year."
  echo "2. 2% interest on savings for the first 6 months."
  echo "3. Free credit card with no annual fees for the first year."
  echo ""
}

# Function to get user details
function get_user_details() {
  read -p "Please enter your full name: " full_name
  read -p "Please enter your age: " age
  read -p "Please enter your address: " address
  read -p "Please enter your job title: " job
  read -p "Please enter your email: " email
  read -p "Please enter your phone number: " phone_number
}

# Function to securely get the password
function get_password() {
  while true; do
    read -sp "Please create your account password: " password
    echo ""
    read -sp "Confirm your password: " password_confirm
    echo ""
    if [ "$password" == "$password_confirm" ]; then
      break
    else
      echo "Passwords do not match. Please try again."
    fi
  done
}

# Function to review and confirm details
function review_details() {
  echo ""
  echo "**************************************"
  echo "*         Review Your Details        *"
  echo "**************************************"
  echo "Full Name: $full_name"
  echo "Age: $age"
  echo "Address: $address"
  echo "Job Title: $job"
  echo "Email: $email"
  echo "Phone Number: $phone_number"
  echo ""
  while true; do
    read -p "Do you confirm that the details are correct? (yes/no): " confirm
    if [ "$confirm" == "yes" ]; then
      break
    elif [ "$confirm" == "no" ]; then
      echo "Please restart the process to correct your details."
      exit 1
    else
      echo "Invalid input. Please type yes or no."
    fi
  done
}

# Main script execution
welcome_message
get_user_details
get_password
review_details

echo ""
echo "**************************************"
echo "*     Profile Successfully Created    *"
echo "**************************************"
echo "Thank you, $full_name, for joining Danske Bank."
echo "We are excited to have you as a customer."
```
