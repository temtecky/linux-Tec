### Loops in Shell Scripting

Loops are used in shell scripting to repeat a block of code multiple times based on certain conditions. There are three main types of loops commonly used in shell scripting:

1. **`for` Loop**
2. **`while` Loop**
3. **`until` Loop**

### 1. **`for` Loop**

The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance, and it iterates over a list of values.

#### Syntax:
```bash
for variable in list
do
    # Commands
done
```

#### Example: Iterating Over a List of Numbers
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```
**Output**:
```
Iteration 1
Iteration 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
Iteration 5
```

#### Example: Iterating Over a List of Strings
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for fruit in apple banana cherry
do
    echo "I like $fruit"
done
```
**Output**:
```
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

#### Example: Using `for` to Loop Through Files
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in /etc/*.conf
do
    echo "Config file: $file"
done
```
This example prints all `.conf` files in the `/etc` directory.

### 2. **`while` Loop**

The `while` loop executes commands as long as a condition remains true. It is commonly used when you do not know how many iterations are required in advance.

#### Syntax:
```bash
while [ condition ]
do
    # Commands
done
```

#### Example: Counting Down with a `while` Loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=5
while [ $count -gt 0 ]
do
    echo "Countdown: $count"
    ((count--))  # Decrement the counter
done
```
**Output**:
```
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
```

#### Example: Reading a File Line by Line
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < "/path/to/file.txt"
```
This example reads a file line by line and prints each line.

### 3. **`until` Loop**

The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it runs until the condition becomes true. It is the opposite of the `while` loop.

#### Syntax:
```bash
until [ condition ]
do
    # Commands
done
```

#### Example: Counting Up with an `until` Loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))  # Increment the counter
done
```
**Output**:
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

---

### 4. **Infinite Loops**

An infinite loop continues forever until it's stopped (usually with `Ctrl+C`). You can create an infinite loop with either `while` or `for`.

#### Example: Infinite `while` Loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true
do
    echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop..."
    sleep 1  # Wait 1 second between iterations
done
```

---

### 5. **`break` and `continue` in Loops**

- **`break`**: Terminates the loop prematurely.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

#### Example: Using `break` to Exit a Loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10}
do
    if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
        break  # Exit the loop when i equals 5
    fi
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```
**Output**:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
```

#### Example: Using `continue` to Skip an Iteration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        continue  # Skip the iteration when i equals 3
    fi
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```
**Output**:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 4
Number: 5
```
