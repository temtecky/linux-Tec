# Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?

Linux is a free, open-source operating system (OS) based on Unix. It was first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. As an OS, Linux manages the hardware resources for the user and provides a set of tools for program development and execution. One of Linux's core components is the Linux kernel, which handles process control, networking, access to peripherals, and file system management.

## Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution (often called a distro) is an OS made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems from embedded devices and personal computers to powerful supercomputers.

### Popular Distributions

- **Ubuntu:** Known for its user-friendliness and active community.
- **Fedora:** Features cutting-edge software and innovations.
- **Debian:** Praised for its stability and reliability.
- **Arch Linux:** Aimed at experienced users who want to customize their OS.
- **CentOS:** Preferred in enterprise environments for its stability and long-term support.

## Linux Architecture

Linux architecture is modular, comprising the Linux kernel, system libraries, and user applications. At its core, the kernel manages the system's resources and hardware. Above the kernel, system libraries provide a set of standard functions that applications can use to perform specific tasks, and user applications provide the functionality to fulfill user needs.

### Key Components

- **Kernel:** The core of the Linux system.
- **System Libraries:** Interface between the kernel and applications.
- **System Utilities:** Programs that perform individual, specialized management tasks.
- **Application Programs:** Various software to perform work or provide services.

## The Linux Filesystem

The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical structure where all files and directories are located under the root directory, denoted by "/". This structure allows for efficient file storage, management, and access. Key directories include:

```sh
/
├── bin/               # Essential user command binaries
├── etc/               # System configuration files
├── home/
│   ├── user1/
│   └── user2/
├── opt/               # Optional add-on applications
├── lib/               # Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
├── mnt/               # Temporary mount point
├── dev/               # Device files
├── var/
│   ├── log/           # Log files
│   └── mail/          # Mail server files
├── proc/              # Process information pseudo-filesystem
└── usr/
    ├── bin/           # User binaries
    ├── lib/           # Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin/
    ├── local/
    │   ├── bin/       # Local binaries
    │   └── lib/       # Local libraries
    └── share/         # Architecture-independent data
````

# Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Explanation

Welcome to an overview of the Linux filesystem hierarchy. This guide will help you understand the structure and purpose of different directories found in a typical Linux system. Linux's filesystem is organized in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root directory (`/`) and branching out into several subdirectories, each serving a specific function.

## /bin - Essential User Binaries

The `/bin` directory contains essential user command binaries that are necessary for basic system operations. These are commands that the system administrator and users use for troubleshooting, repairing, and system maintenance purposes.

## /etc - Configuration Files

`/etc` houses configuration files required by all programs. This includes system initialization scripts, network configurations, and service configuration files. It is the go-to place for system-wide configuration.

## /home - User Home Directories

Each user on the system is assigned a specific directory under `/home`. This directory is intended for storing personal files, configurations, and is the default working directory when a user logs in.

## /opt - Optional Add-on Applications

`/opt` is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages. These are applications that are not part of the default installation and usually come from third-party vendors.

## /tmp - Temporary Files

The `/tmp` directory is used to store temporary files used by applications and the system. Files in this directory may be deleted without notice, such as on system reboot.

## /usr - User Binaries and Read-only Data

`/usr` is one of the largest directories on the system, containing user binaries, their documentation, libraries, header files, and static data. The structure of `/usr` can be further divided into:

- `/usr/bin` - User commands and binary files.
- `/usr/lib` - Libraries for the binaries in `/usr/bin`.
- `/usr/local` - Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to the host.
- `/usr/share` - Architecture-independent (shared) data.

## /var - Variable Files

`/var` contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files.

## Additional Noteworthy Directories

- **/dev** - Device files. These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
- **/lib** - Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.
- **/mnt** - Mount directory for mounting file systems.
- **/proc** - Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, everything is a file.
- **/root** - Home directory for the root user (system administrator).
- **/sbin** - System binaries. Commands used for system administration (and by root).
